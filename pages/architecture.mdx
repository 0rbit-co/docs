# Architecture

The __0rbit__ architecture is pretty simple and easy to understand if you are aware about the working of the `ao` processes on the Arweave network.

## High Level Overview

The __0rbit__ consists of the following components:

#### Main `ao` process 
  - The process which user's `ao` process interacts with to get the data.

#### 0rbit Nodes
  - The network of nodes from which a node fetches the request created by the __main `ao` process__ and then processes it and sends the response back to the __main `ao` process__.

### Step by Step Flow

1. User's `ao` process sends a request to the __main `ao` process__.
2. The __main `ao` process__ then sends the request transaction data to the __Arweave network__.
3. One of the nodes from the __0rbit Nodes network__ fetches the request transaction data.
4. & 5.  The nodes processes the request and fetches the off-chain values.
6. The values are then cross-checked within the __0rbit Nodes network__ and then the response is generated and stored on __Arweave Network.__
7. The node sends the response to the __main `ao` process__.
8. The __main `ao` process__ then sends the response to the user's `ao` process.
