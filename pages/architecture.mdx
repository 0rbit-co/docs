# Architecture

The __0rbit__ architecture is pretty simple and easy to understand if you are aware about the working of the `ao` processes on the Arweave network.

## High Level Overview

![0rbit Architecture](assets/images/architecture/main.png)


The __0rbit__ consists of the following components:

#### Main `ao` process 
  - The process which user's `ao` process interacts with to get the data.

#### 0rbit Nodes
  - The network of nodes from which a node fetches the request created by the __main `ao` process__ and then processes it and sends the response back to the __main `ao` process__.

### Step by Step Flow

<Steps>
### From USER
User's `ao` process sends a request to the __main `ao` process__.
 
### Publishing request on Arweave
The __main `ao` process__ then sends the request transaction data to the __Arweave network__.

### Fetching the request
One of the nodes from the __0rbit Nodes network__ fetches the request transaction data.

### Processing the request
The nodes processes the request.

### Collecting the response
The nodes fetches the response from the ISP.

### Decentralized 0racle Network
The values are then cross-checked within the __0rbit Nodes network__ and then the response is generated and published on __Arweave Network.__

### Receiving the response
One of nodes sends the response to the user's `ao` process.
