# Fetch HTTP Data

__0rbit__ helps in bringing any data from both off-chain and on-chain world, and to bring better DevX we have built a simple HTTP function within our __main `ao` process__ to fetch data from any HTTP endpoint.

## How it works?

The architecture of receiving the data from any HTTP URL is really simple. 

When a request is made from the `ao` process to the 0rbit's `ao` process, the following happens:

<Steps>
### Step 1
Your `ao` process sends the request to the 0rbit's `ao` process with the special tag, i.e., __`Get-Real-Data`__.
 
### Step 2
0rbit's `ao` process checks the tags of the request and then publishes the data on the Arweave Network

### Step 3
0rbit's Decentralized 0rcale Network fetches the request, process the request data and publish the response on the Arweave Network.

### Step 4
One of the 0rbit Nodes sends the data to the user's `ao` process.

</Steps>
