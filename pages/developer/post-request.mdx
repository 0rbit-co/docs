# POST Request

__0rbit__ enables an `ao` process to __FETCH ANY DATA__ using the data body to make a POST request on the Internet.

This is done by sending the `data body` and the URL to the `0rbit` process, which will make the POST request to the `URL` with the `data body` and send the response back to the `ao` process.

> `0rbit` process returns the data in the format the provided URL returns.

## Fee

To make a GET request, you must pay a fee in $0RBT per request. 

This fee is charged for the following reasons:
- To make a sustainable protocol. 
- To prevent spamming of the network.
- Provide incentives to the 0rbit Node Operators.

## Request Methods

Currently, 0rbit supports two methods to make a request:

### Direct Request (Recommended)
You can pay the fee directly from your process to the `0rbit` process, which requires you to have the $0RBT in your `ao` process before making the request.

On every request, you must pay some fee in $0RBT (currently set to 1 $0RBT).

This method accepts the following tags:
| __Tag__ | __Description__ ||
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `["X-Action"]` | The type of request. | Required |
| `["X-Url"]` | The URL from which you want to fetch the data. | Required |
| `["X-Body"]` | The data body to be sent in the POST request. | Required | 
| `["X-Min-Fee"]` | The minimum fee you will pay for the request. | Currently Optional |
| `["X-Max-Fee"]` | The maximum fee you will pay for the request. | Currently Optional |
| `["X-Valid-For"]` | The time for which the request is valid. | Optional |
