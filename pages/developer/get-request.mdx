# GET Request

__0rbit__ enables an `ao` process to __FETCH ANY DATA__ from the Internet. 

This is done by sending the `URL` to the `0rbit` process, which will fetch the data from the `URL` and send it back to the `ao` process.

> `0rbit` process returns the data in the format the provided URL returns.

## Fee

To make a GET request, you must pay a fee in $0RBT per request. 

This fee is charged for the following reasons:
- To make a sustainable protocol. 
- To prevent spamming of the network.
- Provide incentives to the 0rbit Node Operators.

## Request Methods

Currently, 0rbit supports two methods to make a request:

### Direct Request (Recommended)
You can pay the fee directly from your process to the `0rbit` process, which requires you to have the $0RBT in your `ao` process before making the request.

On every request, you must pay some fee in $0RBT (currently set to 1 $0RBT).

This method accepts the following tags:
| __Tag__ | __Description__ ||
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `X-Url` | The URL from which you want to fetch the data. | Required |
| `X-Min-Fee` | The minimum fee you will pay for the request. | Currently Optional |
| `X-Max-Fee` | The maximum fee you will pay for the request. | Currently Optional |
| `X-Valid-For` | The time for which the request is valid. | Optional |
