# GET Request

__0rbit__ enables the `ao` process to __GET ANY DATA__ from the Internet. 

This is done by sending the data URL to the `0rbit` process, which will fetch the data and send it back to the `ao` process.

> `0rbit` process returns the data in the format that the provided URL returns.

## Fee

To make a GET request, you must pay some fee in $0RBT per request. 

This fee is charged for the following reasons:
- To make a sustainable protocol. 
- To prevent spamming of the network.
- Provide incentives to the 0rbit Node Operators.

## Request Methods

Currently, 0rbit supports two methods to make a request:

### Direct Request
You can pay the fee directly from your process to the `0rbit` process, and this requires you to have the $0RBT in your `ao` process before making the request.

On every request, you will be required to pay some fee in $0RBT (currently set to 1 $0RBT).
