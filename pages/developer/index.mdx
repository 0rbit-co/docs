# Getting Started

__0rbit__ helps bring the data from any valid URL to your `ao` process. 

Building with __0rbit__ is as simple as making an HTTP GET or POST request to an API; that's all you need to do in `ao`

## Tags

0rbit works based on tags. In total, it provides three tags:

### `Get-Real-Data`

`Get-Real-Data` is a tag that invokes the GET request Handler in the 0rbit process, which makes the 0rbit nodes make the HTTP GET Request to the provided URL.

<Cards num={1}>
      <Card  title="Learn more about GET Request" href="/developer/get-request/" arrow ="true"/>
</Cards>

### `Post-Real-Data`

`Post-Real-Data` is a tag that invokes the POST request Handler in the 0rbit process, which makes the 0rbit nodes make the HTTP POST Request to the provided URL and the data body.

<Cards num={1}>
      <Card  title="Learn more about POST Request" href="/developer/post-request/" arrow ="true"/>
</Cards>

### `Receive-Response`

Since the 0rbit process forwards the data it receives from the 0rbit Nodes, it needs a handler with a defined tag to call. 

`Receive-Response` is the tag the 0rbit process will call to send the data back to the `ao` process. 

You can create a simple handler in your process and use `msg.Data` to check the data received from the 0rbit process.
