## An Introduction to `aos`

Welcome to the aos quick tour. This tutorial will guide you through aos's essential global functions and variables, providing a solid foundation for effective interaction and utilization.

### Installing aos

The local client of aos is very simple to install. Just make sure you have:
1. NodeJS version 20+
2. A code editor of your choice.

Once you have NodeJS on your machine, all you need to do is install aos and run it:

```bash
npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
```

After installation, we can simply run the command itself to start a new aos process!

```bash
aos
```

### What is `aos` ?

aos is a different approach to building Processes or Contracts, the ao computer is a decentralized computer network that allows compute to run anywhere and aos in a unique interactive shell. You can use aos as your personal operating system, your development environment for building ao Processes.

### Introduction to Inbox

Inbox is a Lua table that stores all messages received by your process but not yet handled. You can check Inbox to see incoming messages. Iterate through Inbox[x] to process these messages.

<Callout>Tip: To display the last message received by your process, use ```Inbox[#Inbox].Data```. To display the transaction ID of the message received, use ```Inbox[#Inbox].Id```.</Callout>

### Introduction to Globals

In aos process there are some Globals that can make development a little more intuitive.

| Name          | Description                                                                                     | Type           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Inbox         | This is a Lua table that stores all the messages that are received and not handled by any handlers. | Table (Array)  |
| Send(Message) | This is a global function available in the interactive environment that allows you to send messages to Processes. | Function       |
| Spawn(Module, Message) | This global function available in the aos interactive environment allows you to spawn processes. | Function       |
| Name          | A string set on init describing the name of your process.                                       | String         |
| Owner         | A string set on init of the process documenting the owner. Changing this value can brick your ability to interact with your process. | String         |
| Handlers      | A Lua Table containing helper functions allowing you to create handlers executing functionality based on pattern matching on inbound messages. | Table          |
| Dump          | A function taking any Lua Table and generating a print-friendly output of the data.              | Function       |
| Utils         | A functional utility library with functions like map, reduce, filter.                            | Module         |
| ao            | Core function library for sending messages and spawning processes.                               | Module         |


### Introduction to Modules

In aos there are some built in common lua modules that are already available for you to work with, these modules can be referenced with a "require" function.

| Name     | Description                                                                                           |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| json     | A JSON module that allows you to encode and decode JSON documents.                                      |
| ao       | Contains ao specific functions like send and spawn.                                                     |
| .base64  | A Base64 module that allows you to encode and decode Base64 text.                                        |
| .pretty  | A pretty print module using the function tprint to output formatted syntax.                             |
| .utils   | A utility function library.                                                                            |
