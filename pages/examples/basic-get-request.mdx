# Your First Get Request 
Create your first `Get` request using the `0rbit`

At core `0rbit` is a `ao` process, which means it can be used by an `ao` process.

## Prerequisite

- Basic understanding of `ao`
- Basic understanding of Arweave.

## Install AOS
<Steps>

### Install __AOS__ 
    ```bash
    npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io
    ```
    AOS is the environment that helps to create and compile `ao` process.

### Initialize the AOS
    ```bash
    aos
    ```
    This will create an `ao` process for your local machine to interact with the `ao` processes.

</Steps>

## AOS Editor
<Steps>

### Start the editor
    ```bash
    .editor
    ```
    This will start the editor for you to write the commands to interact with the `ao` processes.

### Command to interact with the `ao` processes
    
    #### Create a variable
    ```bash
    0RBIT= "WSXUI2JjYUldJ7CKq9wE1MGwXs-ldzlUlHOQszwQe0s"
    ```
    This will create a variable `0RBIT` and assign the value of the process ID of the __0rbit's GET `ao` process__.

    #### Create a `Get` request
    ```bash
    Send({
        Target = 0RBIT,
        Action = "Get-Real-Data",
        Url = "https://dummyjson.com/products"
    })
    ```
    In this command:
    - `TARGET` is the process ID of the ao process user wants to interact with, which in this case is __0rbit's GET `ao` process__.
    - `Action` is the specific tag required by __0rbit__ to perform the `Get` request.
    - `Url` is the URL of the website from which we want to get the data.
    
    This will create a `Get` request and send it to the __0rbit's GET `ao` process__.
      
### Send the command
    ```bash
    .done
    ```
    This will end your editor session, compile the commands and execute it.

### Check the Inbox
    After sending the request, you can check the inbox of your `ao` process to see the response from the __0rbit__.

    Just type the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    #Inbox
    ```
    For this particular example, the response from the __0rbit__ will be a number of products.

    <details>
    <summary>At last your terminal will look like thisüëáüèª</summary>
    #### It has received the response from the __0rbit__.

    </details>

</Steps>

> Voila! You have successfully created your first `Get` request to the __0rbit__. üéâüéâ
