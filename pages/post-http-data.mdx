# Post HTTP Data

__0rbit__ helps in posting __ANY on-chain (`ao` computer) DATA__ directly to the off-chain world using the POST Requests. To bring better DevX we have built a simple Handler in __0rbit's `ao` process__  with `Post-Real-Data` tag, you can use this tag and post the data.

## How it works?

The following architecture to understand the working of the POST Request is as follows:

When a request is made from the `ao` process to the 0rbit's `ao` process, the following happens:

<Steps>
### Step 1
Your `ao` process sends the request to the 0rbit's `ao` process with the special tag, i.e., __`Post-Real-Data`__.
 
### Step 2
0rbit's `ao` process checks the tags of the request and then publishes the data on the Arweave Network

### Step 3
0rbit's Decentralized 0rcale Network fetches the request data from the Arweave Network. 

### Step 4
To avoid multiple requests send by the nodes, a consensus mechanism is used to select a single node to process the request.

### Step 5
The selected node __post the data on the off-chain world using HTTP POST.__
</Steps>
