# Introduction
 
0rbit is a __decentralised__, __permissionless__ and __censorship-resistant__ oracle network built on top of __Arweave__ using __`ao`__.

> __[Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) is a decentralized permanent data storage network.__
>
> Recently, Arweave announced the release of the AO computer on the Arweave Network. 
>
> This is a big step forward for the Arweave Ecosystem as it will enable developers to build smart contracts that can interact with each other on the Arweave Network. 

0rbit takes this to a whole new level by providing a __decentralized Oracle network__ that developers can use to build smart contracts that interact with the real world.

0rbit helps bring __ANY DATA__ from both the on-chain and off-chain world to the `ao` process through a decentralized network of 0rbit Nodes.
