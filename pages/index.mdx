# Introduction to 0rbit on Arweave

0rbit is a **decentralised**, **permissionless** and **censorship-resistant** oracle network built on top of **Arweave** using **`ao`**.

0rbit takes this to a whole new level by providing a **decentralized Oracle network** that developers can use to build smart contracts that interact with the real world.

0rbit helps bring **ANY DATA** from both the on-chain and off-chain world to the `ao` process through a decentralized network of 0rbit Nodes.

This is a big step forward for the Arweave Ecosystem as it will enable developers to build smart contracts that can interact with each other on the Arweave Network.
